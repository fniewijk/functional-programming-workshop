# functional-programming-workshop

How to start: 

Run `npm install`

then

Run `npm run test:watch`

Implement these rules for an imperative program and a functional program.

Tic Tac Toe Rules:

- Player 1 starts.
- A player has to make a move within a 3x3 square.
- Player 1 and player 2 alternate moves. After player 1 it is player 2's turn, then back to player 1.
- A player wins when it has connected 3 moves horizontally or vertically or diagonally within the square.


for bonus points:

- What happens if two moves are the same, what would your tests look like for both imperative and functional solutions.
- Think about how saving and loading would work for both imperative and functional solutions.
